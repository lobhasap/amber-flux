Assignment:

Create a FastAPI application that performs the following tasks:

Video Processing:
- Implement an endpoint that accepts a video file upload (e.g., MP4 format).
- Extract frames from the uploaded video at a specified interval (e.g., every second).
- Save the extracted frames as images in a specified output directory.

Feature Vector Computation:
- For each extracted frame, compute a simple feature vector (e.g., using color histograms or any other method of your choice).
- Store the feature vectors in a vector database of your choice (Qdrant etc.).

API for Retrieval:
- Implement an endpoint that allows querying the vector database for similar frames based on a given feature vector.
- The endpoint should return the relevant frame images and their corresponding feature vectors.

Your submission should be a github link that we can review (code, output, documentation etc).
